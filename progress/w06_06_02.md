<u>Self assessment of how I felt this week:</u>

- My mood this week was exciting because we finished with the elewa-group project and we are starting another project.
  
- Compared to last week, I feel more excited and grateful to the Elewa software engineers who helped whenever I was stuck.

- I find the project to be joyful and challengin especially since it is a new project.

- My level of stress is manageable.
