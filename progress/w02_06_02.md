### My lessons
<!-- What did I learn? -->
<u>Everything I learned</u>

- Basics of Angular.
- How to create a pull request.
- Resolving merge conflicts between main and a branch.

<u>The key lesson(s) of this week:</u>

Observables are timelines. Values which change over time. Using Rxjs, a system can be developed to react to these timelines, hence the name "reactive programming."

### How I am doing
<!-- How did you feel? -->
<u>Self assessment of how I felt this week:</u>

- My mood this week was a mixture of excitement and being overwhelmed because I managed to create pull requests but I ended up getting merge conflicts and thus my work was closed.
  
- Compared to last week, I feel more encouraged but yet overhwelmed and disappointed because I failed in creating and merging my pull requests but I am excited because I got to learn on how to deal with merge conflicts and different git commands.

- I find the project to be exciting and challenging.

- My level of stress is manageable.
