### How I am doing
<!-- How did you feel? -->
<u>Self assessment of how I felt this week:</u>

- My mood this week was overwhelmed as I felt as if I have forgotten core concepts of Angular.
  
- Compared to last week, I feel more encouraged because I have gone through the Angular documentation and got some more understanding on core concepts.
- I find the project to be challenging.

- My level of stress is high.
